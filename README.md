Overall comments on grading questions:

1) Does your site make the information easy to find?
    - Better than the original, but some things could still be easier.
    - I can't find how to email the BoE.
    - The Absentee Ballot Application form is mentioned but not linked.
    - I have to dig and do some math to find the registration/absentee deadlines in 2020.
    - I have to dig and do some math to find the early voting dates in 2020.

2) Are the pages reasonably structured with HTML?
    - For the most part, yes.
    - The home page isn't called index.html, which is the traditional name.
    - The Absentee Voting page is outside the main navigational structure, which makes it harder to find.
    - The Voter Requirement list is marked up with paragraphs instead of a proper list.
    - Election dates & deadlines seem well suited to table formats.

3) Are the pages tolerably styled with Bootstrap?
    - For the most part, yes.
    - Text in all-caps tends to be hard to read.
    - The list on the Absentee page needs more left margin.
    - The navbar doesn't have active-link highlighting, so visitors can't keep track of where they are.
